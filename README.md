# Weather App

## Uses Openweathermap.org API

To get it to work:
* Clone this Repo 
* sign up for a free account at https://openweathermap.org/
* Grab the API key from the settings and insert it into app.js on line 5
* Change the port on app.js (at the bottom) to 3000 instead of (process.env.PORT/Process.env.IP)
